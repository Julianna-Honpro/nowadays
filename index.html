To save more time for the SAT preparation, he wanted to find an agent who's more familiar with the process than him to help with the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the year of 2009, one year later of Beijing Olympic Games, the oversea study group had its biggest increase rate since 1987: 27.5 per cent.
                    </p>
                    <p>He approached to a big study-abroad agency in Beijing. After a payment of 40 thousand RMB, the agency agreed to help him apply for about ten different universities. Three “teachers” were arranged to take his case, one in charge of school choosing, one for document writing, and one for materials submitting and communicating with the target schools.
                    </p>
                    <p>If he was taken in by any school and decided to go, he’d have to pay for another “fee of successful application” to the agency depend on the world ranking of that school.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike some other students, Tang followed tightly on the process of application: “I’ve heard before that students need to urge the ‘teachers’ to work, because usually each teacher would have many applicants on hand to process. Your impression to them would decide how much attention they pay on you,” said Tang.
                    </p>
                    <p>His actively contact received great feedback from the first stage’s teacher, who listed a group of universities that suit Tang and encouraged him to keep being active.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I felt that my future is going to be a bright one,” recalled Tang for his mood at that time: “the teacher showed me some cases that formal students in my level had achieved,
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:200%;"><strong>I felt hot blood running in my body<br> and I was ready to make the miracle</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p> (that I got accepted by some really good universities) come true”.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, things started to change as his was noticed through email that the other two of the teachers in his case were about to be replaced by two new ones: “my document consultant is changed because the one before was out for business, but they didn’t tell me why the teacher that in charge of material submitting is changed too”.
                    </p>
                     <p>Tang tried to book an appointment with the new material submitting teacher, but the front desk told him that “they don’t know this person”. He also found that his new teacher’s email, different from the ones before, didn’t have standard company format.
                    </p>
                     <p>“I thought he was a new teacher, so I didn’t care too much,” said Tang. In October, which is around the hottest time for applicants to submit their package, Tang, as well as many other students that were applying for colleges in the US, was busying visiting the agency everyday.
                    </p>
                     <p>One thing surprised Tang: “the document consultant barely had time to talk with every students. I emailed him for several times, he replied and asked me to write the document in Chinese first, he’d do the translate later. This is so different from what they had promised.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-2">

            <div class="row">

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-3">
                    <p>Considering the low efficiency for the translation to came out each time and the mistakes in some early translated versions, Tang decided to rely on himself. He started to check the documents carefully, providing his own English statements and asked for other people to help. Eventually, the writing documents that he needed to submit were merely ready by the deadline of early decision/action. 
                    </p>
                    <p>(Notice that most US colleges have the process of early decision/action <a href="http://www.chivast.com/usa/undergraduate/201610/45005.html">[ed, ea]</a> which would end at the end of the year before the admission. The applicants of the ed have to apply for one school only and promise to go to this one once he/she get taken in. For ea, the applicant is usually not bond to one university, but he/she has to answer the offer before a certain time once the result is released.)
                    </p>
                    <p>After the documents’ disturbance, Tang shifted his focus to the work of the material submitting teacher. He wanted to look at his own application account on Common App, a website through which a students can apply for most of the public universities in the US.
                    </p>
                    <p>But he was not allowed to have the account: “in case that you use it to apply for other universities privately,” said the agent. But this kind of holding-accounts behavior is never listed in the contract or any document of the company.

                <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
                    <p>However, one week after Tang submitted all the materials that were needed, he found that his package was still not submitted: “I checked the official website of Collegeboard and TOFEL, they didn’t have the history of sending my SAT and TOEFL scores to anywhere, which means that my profile on Common App was not submitted yet. Also I didn’t receive any notice from the bank that the fee for application was deducted”.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tang approached to the teacher, she told him that it’s fine to submit the scores late, meaning that she’ve already submitted the other materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>Time flies, by the time that the results of the early action universities Tang applied had came out already, Tang still got zero offers or rejection letters from the agent. He asked, only received the reply that “it’s normal to have some delay”.
                    </p>
                    <p>He and his family finally noticed that there was something wrong. They can’t reach the material submitting teacher by phone anymore.   
                    </p>
                    <p>Tang’s family terminated the contract with only half of the money refunded, and turned to other people to help applying. 
                    </p>
                    <p>By the time Tang got the record of score submitting, his account of University of California (UC) application, and his account of Common App, he was shocked by the many mistakes and omissions in his profile:           
                    </p>
                    <p>Many of the contents he provided for the section of “extra-criculirrium and accomplishments” were not submitted in his account of Common App. In the system of UC application, some last words of the original content went missing due to word limitation, one section even had half of a word remained at the end, these was the result of the teacher’s careless copy and paste.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some content ended up as digital gibberish due to copy and paste errors in the UA application system but the teacher left them be that way.
                    </p>
                    <p>For each application, one reference letter was missing. And according to the record, the time when Tang’s SAT2 score was submitted was nearly one month after the deadline.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I called to the admission office of my target universities, they told me the reason they didn’t receive my application was because some important materials, the transcript and the financial prove, were never submitted. But I had handed in them to the agency even earlier than the new teachers came in.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, in Tang’s mailbox which was used for application, there were only emails of Common App left, Tang suspected that all the other emails from universities were deleted before the account was opened to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I warned a friend of mine who had the same material submitting teacher as I did,” said Tang:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:200%;"><strong>“soon later I received an email from that teacher asking me not to ’mislead’ other students”</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the end, “this friend of mine failed on each universities he applied due to unknown mistakes that were not allowed to see in the accounts,” said Tang: “according to what he told me, the senior teachers in the agency did ‘emergent rescue’ on his application and got him the offer of his minimum guarantee school.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Eventually, Tang got into the New York University: “I think the delay in application period made me missed the chance to get in three to four universities that were originally very hopeful.”

                    </p>
                    <p>Tang and his friend were not the only one that suffered from the agencies’ neglect and blind operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>As concluded by Mr Caoxian Shui, the co-founder of agency Hiture, the most common problem that customers raised for the industry is the neglect and careless behaviours of the agents.
                    </p>
                     <p>Serena, a Chinese student currently studying in Australia now, was not allowed to see her application accounts either. What’s more, she was not able to see the personal statements that the agent submitted for her.
                    </p>
                     <p>But she got offers from the top three Australian universities that she applied successfully, she was generally very satisfy with the agents’ service: “by the time I was applying, it was quite late already, I’m very happy that they made it on time”. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Another student, T, applied universities in the US through JiaQiao Education in Shenzhen. The agency was very popular in her class when she was in high school. Different from some other agencies, JiaQiao provide English native-speaker for the service of documents writing, this though, cost the students a higher price than others. T paid nearly 100 thousand RMB for the application, but received very less attention from the agents. 
                     </p>
                     <p>She felt for that great amount of money, the American document consultants that was assigned to her should be responsible for one student only, but not five.
                     </p>
                     <p>However, there are some study-abroad agencies that don’t bother with the problem that may caused by stuff’s neglect: they simply allow students to apply by themselves, but not holding the application accounts secretly.
                     </p>
                     <p>Ms Lucy Lu’s agency, Boost Education, for example, shared the email address and application account details with her when she hired them for postgraduate degree’s application. For some family and private questions, the agent would wait for Lu to fill in, for the common application sections like education background, accomplishments and extra-curriculum, the agent would help her fill in according to the information she provided. If the sharing email account, which is used for all of the applications, receives any notice from the universities, both the agent and the applicant would know, thus they don’t have to waste the time telling each other.
                     </p>
                     <p>“We (me and the agent) basically cooperated with each other along the way of application,” said Lu: “they help me refine my personal statements but I’ll also check them myself, they know it and they trust my English ability.”
                     </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:150%;"><strong>The lack of manpower and the conflict between profit and cost </strong> 
                    </p>
                    <p>are the main reasons that lead to the neglect and blind operation problem of today’s study-abroad agencies, said Mr Shui, who has been working in the industry from more than eight years.
                    </p>
                    <p>“The number of people seeking oversea education is increasing dramatically at around 2012, while the industry of study-abroad agents is still a new one,” said Mr Shui in one of his online open classes that are posted on his own agent company’s website: “most agencies don’t have enough people to do 1 vs 1 with customers”.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to his company’s inner research when Mr Shui was working for the biggest study-abroad agencies in China during 2008 to 2009, a normal agents that in charge of college of business school’s application can take around 12 to 16 cases in one application period. If hs/she is outstanding, an agent can take more than 20 cases. However, once the number breaks 22, “it’d be very likely to have quality problem,” said Mr Shui.               
                    </p>
                    <p>For a postgraduate application agents, the normal volume in one application period is 16-20, those with stronger ability can work for around 25 cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I myself used to have 33 clients in 2008,” said the founder of Hiture Education: “but the cost was that I merely went home in three months.”

                   <p>Tang and the authenticity of his diplomas stirred a heated debate. In 2011, Tang admitted in an interview that he bought a diploma from Pacific Western University for $3000 U.S.
                   </p>
                   <p>“That was because I felt shameful that I didn’t have a doctorate degree,” said Tang in the <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/it/2011-04/12/c_121296323.htm", target="_blank">interview</a>, “I have to say it was out of vanity.”     
                   </p>
                   <p>The scandal of Tang Jun’s fake diploma rang alarm bells for these diploma mills. The Ministry of Education then published a list of unqualified universities which  study-abroad agencies tried to cheat their customers into attending.
                   </p>
                   <p>Here’s the USA part of the list:
                   </p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Dickinson State University
                       </li>
                        <li>California American University
                       </li>
                        <li>Pacific Western University (now California Miramar University)
                       </li>
                        <li>Armstrong University
                       </li>
                        <li>Nation University
                       </li>
                        <li>Kennedy-Western University (now Warren National University)
                       </li>
                        <li>Honolulu University
                       </li>
                        <li>International East-West University

                        <li>Barrington University (now University of Atlanta)
                       </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For students who wanted to go abroad for just a short period of time, usually within six months, these diploma mills were easy to get admitted into. Graduation is guaranteed. Their names  sound bona fide and often good enough to lure students with poor academic performance to fall victim.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Some small agencies would get kickbacks for each student they send to these diploma mills,” said Ren. “They (those schools) need students, the students need a diploma and the agencies need money”.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr Shui, co-founder of a study-abroad agency, Hiture, agreed. “ The Ministry of Education listed the recognised agencies in the FE Network,. These are the ones that can really recruit students in China for  service for  universities overseas.”
                    </p>
                    <p>For  universities which have difficulties  recruiting students, these study-abroad agencies are a good help. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:140%;"><strong>“As long as you have the money and a reasonable score, 
                        <br>you can get in those universities”</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>, said Mr Shui. “The Ministry’s regulation in 1999 cut off those agencies that cooperate with foreign ‘diploma mills’ effectively.”’
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2014, the Ministry of Education released a policy to maintain the quality of Chinese students’ oversea education.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to FE Network, students who want to go abroad need to  get a certificate from the Chinese embassy at the country where they studied in order to prove the authenticity of their foreign diplomas.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:140%;"><strong>“The so-called ‘diploma’ from diploma mills is nothing but <br>a piece of waste paper”</strong> 
                    </p>
                    <p>, said in a notification of FE Network.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2015, a gang of five people, who sold fake diplomas to Chinese people for between 100,000 and 200,000 RMB, were caught by the police.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the defendants admitted in the court that she faked the registration of a non-existent   university with an American partner. In fact, there was no staff or teaching facilities. It was not recognized by the U.S. or China, but it could still “issue” postgraduate and phD diplomas to those who paid for a fake diploma. (<a href="http://goabroad.sohu.com/20150106/n407573641.shtml", target="_blank">Read the original report [in Chinese]</a>)
                    </p>
                    <p>Government regulations in recent years have raised public awareness  of “fake diplomas” and “agencies”. But the advertisements for these agencies are still everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>On an international book-reading online community, <i>Goodreads</i>, a one post in Chinese claimed it could provide fake diploma and transcript for students in need.
                    </p>
                    <p>The company said that they have experience in providing certificates from famous universities in Australia, Canada, UK, New Zealand, U.S., France and Germany. An Australian public university, Southern Cross University, was specially named in the title. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The post stated that it aims to help Chinese students who “need a graduation certificate when going home during the Lunar New Year”, who “fail on too many subjects and need a certificate to find jobs” and more.

                    <p>Although the very first group of education institutions in Mainland China was established as early as in the 1990s, the real market of study-abroad agent and consulting business didn’t start to fly till 2005, before which time the study-abroad services in China were mainly focus on destinations like Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and other European countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>The difficulty of getting a US student visa before 2005 has to account for that.  
                    </p>
                    <p>At the beginning of this industry in 1990s, most education institutions were focus on English teaching and testing taking skills. As the gate of international universities just opened, professional English training and experience sharing for TOEFL, GRE tests were treasury resources for millions of Chinese students who dreamt of going to a better place.  
                    </p>
                    <p>However, since “911” territory attack in 2001, US, as a main target that Chinese students would apply, tightened the visa policies. 
                    </p>
                    <p>As a result, even that more and more Chinese students, by virtue of of their hardworking and assiduousness, got cheerful results from the universities they applied, still failed to go abroad because of the strict rules in visa examination.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to a news release for Consulate-General of the People’s Republic of China in Houston on September of 2004, the visa reject rate for Chinese applicants was as high as 30 to 65 per cent at that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before 2005, 95 per cent of the visa applicants were required to come for fingerprint and an <a href="http://houston.china-consulate.org/chn/zt/ljzg/t157821.htm", target="_blank">interview</a> in the embassy.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, each visa officer had only averagely 3 minutes to determine whether this person could go to the US due to the high volume of applicants. Once the officer came to the conclusion that this person had the inclination to stay in US, the application would be rejected.
                    </p>
                    <p>A lot of Chinese people then were the “victim” of the strict visa rule. Mr Zhao, the co-founder of study-abroad agency Hiture, were rejected for three times before 2005, he ended up going to Singapore instead of the US for further education.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:140%;"><strong>“Even a full scholarship from Ivy League can’t guarantee you a visa to the US”</strong> 
                    </p>
                    <p>,said another co-founder of Hiture, Mr Shui: “let alone other universities’ admission offers.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“There were a visa officer in US Embassy in Beijing at that time, he was called ‘full-scholarship killer’. The normal way he rejected students’ visa was that, he’d asked how many schools did you get the scholarship, why you choose this one over others at first; then he’d claim that you only want to go to the US because this school offers you scholarship. As a result, he would say that you can earn more in US, thus you have the tendency to immigrant,” said Mr Shui.
                    </p>
                    <p>Yu Minhong, the founder of New Oriental Education, which is the biggest English education institution now in China, also experienced the failure of visa application for years. Eventually he gave up and start the business of English teaching in China, which led him to today’s success.
                    </p>
                    <p>In response to the market need, education institutions before 2005 begun to offer help on visa application. They provide model visa interview, materials checking and other relative trainings. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Based on various students’ visa application experience, one of the famous study-agent today, Taisha.org, even concluded and published an online guidance, named “<a href="http://www.taisha.org/abroad/visa/usa/application/200703/20070324162045.html", target="_blank">the Art of Visa</a>” in 2006 in order to help Chinese people better understanding the process of application and what they can do to take control of the interview conversation when facing the visa officer.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Numerous fake documents in the application profiles and a lot of illegal Chinese immigrants inside the border of US were also part of the reason why the applications were handled, said an anonymous visa officer said in the news release in 2005.
