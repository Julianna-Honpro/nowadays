To save more time for the SAT preparation, he wanted to find an agent who's more familiar with the process than him to help with the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the year of 2009, one year later of Beijing Olympic Games, the oversea study group had its biggest increase rate since 1987: 27.5 per cent.
                    </p>
                    <p>He approached to a big study-abroad agency in Beijing. After a payment of 40 thousand RMB, the agency agreed to help him apply for about ten different universities. Three “teachers” were arranged to take his case, one in charge of school choosing, one for document writing, and one for materials submitting and communicating with the target schools.
                    </p>
                    <p>If he was taken in by any school and decided to go, he’d have to pay for another “fee of successful application” to the agency depend on the world ranking of that school.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike some other students, Tang followed tightly on the process of application: “I’ve heard before that students need to urge the ‘teachers’ to work, because usually each teacher would have many applicants on hand to process. Your impression to them would decide how much attention they pay on you,” said Tang.
                    </p>
                    <p>His actively contact received great feedback from the first stage’s teacher, who listed a group of universities that suit Tang and encouraged him to keep being active.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I felt that my future is going to be a bright one,” recalled Tang for his mood at that time: “the teacher showed me some cases that formal students in my level had achieved,
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:200%;"><strong>I felt hot blood running in my body<br> and I was ready to make the miracle</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p> (that I got accepted by some really good universities) come true”.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, things started to change as his was noticed through email that the other two of the teachers in his case were about to be replaced by two new ones: “my document consultant is changed because the one before was out for business, but they didn’t tell me why the teacher that in charge of material submitting is changed too”.
                    </p>
                     <p>Tang tried to book an appointment with the new material submitting teacher, but the front desk told him that “they don’t know this person”. He also found that his new teacher’s email, different from the ones before, didn’t have standard company format.
                    </p>
                     <p>“I thought he was a new teacher, so I didn’t care too much,” said Tang. In October, which is around the hottest time for applicants to submit their package, Tang, as well as many other students that were applying for colleges in the US, was busying visiting the agency everyday.
                    </p>
                     <p>One thing surprised Tang: “the document consultant barely had time to talk with every students. I emailed him for several times, he replied and asked me to write the document in Chinese first, he’d do the translate later. This is so different from what they had promised.”

                    <p>Considering the low efficiency for the translation to came out each time and the mistakes in some early translated versions, Tang decided to rely on himself. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>He started to check the documents carefully, providing his own English statements and asked for other people to help. Eventually, the writing documents that he needed to submit were merely ready by the deadline of early decision/action. 
                    </p>
                    <p>(Notice that most US colleges have the process of early decision/action <a href="http://www.chivast.com/usa/undergraduate/201610/45005.html" target="_blank">[ed, ea]</a>, which would end at the end of the year before the admission. The applicants of the ed have to apply for one school only and promise to go to this one once he/she get taken in. For ea, the applicant is usually not bond to one university, but he/she has to answer the offer before a certain time once the result is released.)

                     <p>After the documents’ disturbance, Tang shifted his focus to the work of the material submitting teacher. He wanted to look at his own application account on Common App, a website through which a students can apply for most of the public universities in the US.
                    </p>
                    <p>But he was not allowed to have the account: “in case that you use it to apply for other universities privately,” said the agent. But this kind of holding-accounts behavior is never listed in the contract or any document of the company.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, one week after Tang submitted all the materials that were needed, he found that his package was still not submitted: “I checked the official website of Collegeboard and TOFEL, they didn’t have the history of sending my SAT and TOEFL scores to anywhere, which means that my profile on Common App was not submitted yet. Also I didn’t receive any notice from the bank that the fee for application was deducted”.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tang approached to the teacher, she told him that it’s fine to submit the scores late, meaning that she’ve already submitted the other materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>Time flies, by the time that the results of the early action universities Tang applied had came out already, Tang still got zero offers or rejection letters from the agent. He asked, only received the reply that “it’s normal to have some delay”.
                    </p>
                    <p>He and his family finally noticed that there was something wrong. They can’t reach the material submitting teacher by phone anymore.   
                    </p>
                    <p>Tang’s family terminated the contract with only half of the money refunded, and turned to other people to help applying. 
                    </p>
                    <p>By the time Tang got the record of score submitting, his account of University of California (UC) application, and his account of Common App, he was shocked by the many mistakes and omissions in his profile:           
                    </p>
                    <p>Many of the contents he provided for the section of “extra-criculirrium and accomplishments” were not submitted in his account of Common App. In the system of UC application, some last words of the original content went missing due to word limitation, one section even had half of a word remained at the end, these was the result of the teacher’s careless copy and paste.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some content ended up as digital gibberish due to copy and paste errors in the UA application system but the teacher left them be that way.
                    </p>
                    <p>For each application, one reference letter was missing. And according to the record, the time when Tang’s SAT2 score was submitted was nearly one month after the deadline.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I called to the admission office of my target universities, they told me the reason they didn’t receive my application was because some important materials, the transcript and the financial prove, were never submitted. But I had handed in them to the agency even earlier than the new teachers came in.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, in Tang’s mailbox which was used for application, there were only emails of Common App left, Tang suspected that all the other emails from universities were deleted before the account was opened to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I warned a friend of mine who had the same material submitting teacher as I did,” said Tang:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:200%;"><strong>“soon later I received an email from that teacher asking me not to ’mislead’ other students”</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the end, “this friend of mine failed on each universities he applied due to unknown mistakes that were not allowed to see in the accounts,” said Tang: “according to what he told me, the senior teachers in the agency did ‘emergent rescue’ on his application and got him the offer of his minimum guarantee school.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Eventually, Tang got into the New York University: “I think the delay in application period made me missed the chance to get in three to four universities that were originally very hopeful.”

                    </p>
                    <p>Tang and his friend were not the only one that suffered from the agencies’ neglect and blind operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>As concluded by Mr Caoxian Shui, the co-founder of study-abroad agency <i>Hiture</i>, the most common problem that customers raised for the industry is the neglect and careless behaviours of the agents.
                    </p>
                     <p>Serena, a Chinese student currently studying in Australia now, was not allowed to see her application accounts either. What’s more, she was not able to see the personal statements that the agent submitted for her.
                    </p>
                     <p>But she got offers from the top three Australian universities that she applied successfully, she was generally very satisfy with the agents’ service: “by the time I was applying, it was quite late already, I’m very happy that they made it on time”. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Another student, T, applied universities in the US through JiaQiao Education in Shenzhen. The agency was very popular in her class when she was in high school. Different from some other agencies, JiaQiao provide English native-speaker for the service of documents writing, this though, cost the students a higher price than others. T paid nearly 100 thousand RMB for the application, but received very less attention from the agents. 
                     </p>
                     <p>She felt for that great amount of money, the American document consultants that was assigned to her should be responsible for one student only, but not five.
                     </p>
                     <p>However, there are some study-abroad agencies that don’t bother with the problem that may caused by stuff’s neglect: they simply allow students to apply by themselves, but not holding the application accounts secretly.
                     </p>
                     <p>Ms Lucy Lu’s agency, Boost Education, for example, shared the email address and application account details with her when she hired them for postgraduate degree’s application. For some family and private questions, the agent would wait for Lu to fill in, for the common application sections like education background, accomplishments and extra-curriculum, the agent would help her fill in according to the information she provided. If the sharing email account, which is used for all of the applications, receives any notice from the universities, both the agent and the applicant would know, thus they don’t have to waste the time telling each other.
                     </p>
                     <p>“We (me and the agent) basically cooperated with each other along the way of application,” said Lu: “they help me refine my personal statements but I’ll also check them myself, they know it and they trust my English ability.”
                     </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:150%;"><strong>The lack of manpower and the conflict between profit and cost </strong> 
                    </p>
                    <p>are the main reasons that lead to the neglect and blind operation problem of today’s study-abroad agencies, said Mr Shui, who has been working in the industry from more than eight years.
                    </p>
                    <p>“The number of people seeking oversea education is increasing dramatically at around 2012, while the industry of study-abroad agents is still a new one,” said Mr Shui in one of his online open classes that are posted on his own agent company’s website: “most agencies don’t have enough people to do 1 vs 1 with customers”.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to his company’s inner research when Mr Shui was working for the biggest study-abroad agencies in China during 2008 to 2009, a normal agents that in charge of college of business school’s application can take around 12 to 16 cases in one application period. If hs/she is outstanding, an agent can take more than 20 cases. However, once the number breaks 22, “it’d be very likely to have quality problem,” said Mr Shui.               
                    </p>
                    <p>For a postgraduate application agents, the normal volume in one application period is 16-20, those with stronger ability can work for around 25 cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I myself used to have 33 clients in 2008,” said the founder of <i>Hiture Education</i>: “but the cost was that I merely went home in three months.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Also the company may lie to their customers in terms that their kids is one of how many case the agent is having on his hands:”it’s better for the profit to have as many clients as possible with as less cost as possible.”

                   <p>“Before I was very confused how could a study-abroad agent do this,” said Mr Shui: “later I know that
                   </p>
                   <p style="text-align:center; font-size:150%;"><strong>very few parents and students who would actually do and know how to do the research on the agencies before signing the contract</strong>
                   </p>
                   <p>The low profit for each agent to get from one case is another reason that cause them to be careless in each cases, Tang said, in order to increase their income, the agents would usually expand the customer range as much as they can, so the lost of one or two among them is not much.
                   </p>
                   <p>“After all, both the agents and companies would want to have more successful cases as well in order to promote their reputation in the market”, said Tang: 
                   </p>
                   <p style="text-align:center; font-size:150%;"><strong>"they’ll focus on the students that are <br>more likely to get good application results"</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>In many agencies, the customers would expect to leave everything with the agents as far as they paid. “This kind of opaque operation is the most risky thing for the customers. As in any company, there must be some amount’s careless or irresponsible employees,” said Mr Shui: “there was this agent who forget to submit the client’s application till almost the beginning of the new semester. He could only lie to the customer saying that the school didn’t take him. How scary this is.”
                    </p>
                    <p>This kind of mistake and neglect is not the most common problem in the industry, but it’s the most damage one to the customer. “I strongly suggest applicants to follow tightly the whole process of application, not to choose those opaque agents that would not even give you the access to application email and other application documents,” said Mr Shui.
                    </p>
                    <p>The pain of missing a dream school due to the agent’s misbehaviour may be very harmful, but that’s probably better than being quitted in the middle of the study because the school has found out some untruthful materials in your application package.      
                    </p>
                    <p>That’s what happened to Xuan “Claren” Rong, who was accepted in 2015 by the University of California, Davis, through a study-abroad agency, Cunshande, also known as Transcend Education in Shenzhen.
                    </p>
                    <p>As reported by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/college-cheating-iowa/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> in May 2015, Rong received investigation after the university, together with other one hundred US universities, received emails from an anonymous former Transcend employee.
                    </p>
                    <p>The emails included details about 40 Chinese applicants, including Rong: “I am writing this e-mail to inform you that the student Xuan Rong … under the influence of Cunshande, a company which ghostwrites applications for Chinese students applying to American universities, committed application fraud”.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reuters revealed that the Shenzhen high school’s transcript that Rong submitted when applying for the university was a fake one, Rong never went to that high school in Shenzhen, on the contrary, he dropped from a US high school in 2015.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rong later was expelled from UC, Davis. His father admitted in the interview with Reuters that they obtained the fake transcript under Transcend's suggestion.
                    </p>
                    <p>Transcend was also accused of ghostwriting the application material including personal statements and reference letters for the applicants. Rong’s statements received dramatically improvements after several versions’ revise by Transcend, as showed by the revealer’s email.

                    <p>Surprisingly, helping applicants to write the English documents seemed to became a basic service provided by every agency in China.
                    </p>
                    <p>All the interviewees listed above had experienced the document writing service from their agents, it’s only the matter of good quality one and bad one.   
                    </p>
                    <p>As a sample 2016’s contract of New Oriental’s study-abroad agency - <i>Vision Overseas</i> - shows, the English documents that they could help write are essay, Reference letter (RL), CV and personal statement (PS).
                    </p>
                    <p>For a postgraduate applicant that is looking forward to go the the US, the fee for the whole set of document writing (one PS, three RL and one CV) is 9800 RMB, for foreign or high-end teacher’s refine on the set, the cost would be 12k RMB. The fee for a single piece of documents, include essay, CV and RL ranges from one to two thousand RMB. For one piece of PS, it’s 6000 RMB.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let alone Vision Overseas, the advertisement of document writing service could be find on basically all of the agencies’ website in China.

                    <p>“They basically translated the versions we write in Chinese,” Ms J Lo described how her agents in Vision Overseas conducted the contract regarding documents writing: “it’s not that I can’t write as well as they did, it saves time by doing so.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Each customers in Vision Overseas had to fill in a long form about his/her personal details after signing the contract. That was where the agents got the materials to translate from.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Ms Lu, who used Boost Education in Beijing, the document writing service provided a shortcut in preparing the applications: “around 60 per cent of the content were offered by me, and whatever they write I’ll have to check and agree”.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I believe applicants in the US would want to see how the successful documents were like as well,” said Ms Lu: “if there’s a shortcut, why don’t use it?”

                    <p>An education agency in the California, the US, provided service that “assist in personal statements” as well.

                     <p>Under this background, a very common problem that student may find during their contract with the agencies would be that the documents they receive do not meet their requirements.

                    <p>Some has very poor English and bad quality, some are formatting documents that writes something that doesn’t belong to this student at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It really depends on your agent’s English level and how the company treat their customers,” said Mr Shui.
                    </p>
                    <p>In terms of the reference letter, it seems to be an off-record conduct in mainland China for students to write the letter himself/herself, and give to the teachers for a signature or stamp.

                    <p>“Some teachers or professors may check whether the thing you write is true on you, some may just sign it and let go,” said Ms J Lo, who’s an university student in Beijing: “there’re too many students in one class in China, professors and teachers can’t remember them all.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Except for the ghostwriting, Mr Shui concluded some other common problems that were usually claimed by customers: adding various fees including visa, flight ticket and tuition fees after signing the cheap-price-contract, performed totally different after receiving the payment and only help apply for some easy-enter universities and majors.
                    </p>
                    <p>Adding money after the student receive offers successfully is also another controversial item, but parents are mostly willing to pay for this, “because the better school students get taken it, it seems that the agents have done more work,” said Mr Shui.
